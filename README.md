# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository! This repo is a collection of the LeetCode problems that I’ve solved during my coding practice. My goal with this repository is twofold:

1. **Help others** who are looking for solutions to LeetCode problems by providing organized and documented answers.
2. **Revisit** my own solutions over time to track my progress and improve further.

## Table of Contents

This repository is organized into folders, each containing solutions for specific categories of problems. Click on a folder below to navigate to its contents:

- [SQL 50 (Using PostgreSQL)](./sql50_postgresql)

> **Note:** Each folder contains solutions on the respective leetcode list which is also the name of the folder. Please feel free to fork or star the repo for your study.

## How to Use

- Browse the folders listed in the Table of Contents to find the problem category you're interested in.
- Inside each folder, you’ll find solutions with the following format:
  - `problem_name.ext` (e.g., `two_sum.py`, `reverse_linked_list.java`)
  - Code is well-commented for clarity and easy understanding.
  - Where applicable, I’ve added explanations and references to time and space complexity.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions for improving anything at all, feel free to submit an issue or a pull request. Let’s make learning and practicing coding more accessible together!
