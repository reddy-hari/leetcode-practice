Using a Self Join
```sql
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
    JOIN Weather w2 ON w1.recordDate - w2.recordDate = 1
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature
```

Using LAG
```sql
SELECT id
FROM (
        SELECT id, temperature, LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate ) AS previous_temperature
        FROM Weather
    )
WHERE temperature > previous_temperature
```
