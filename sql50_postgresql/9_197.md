Using a Self Join

```sql
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2 ON w1.recordDate - w2.recordDate = 1
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature
```

Using LAG

```sql
SELECT id
FROM (
        SELECT id, temperature, LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate ) AS previous_temperature
        FROM Weather
    )
WHERE temperature > previous_temperature
```

Using CTE

```sql
WITH PreviousWeatherData AS
(
    SELECT
    w.id,
    w.recordDate,
    w.temperature,
    LAG(temperature, 1) OVER (ORDER BY w.recordDate) AS previous_temperature,
    LAG(recordDate, 1) OVER (ORDER BY w.recordDate) AS previous_record_date
    FROM Weather w
)

SELECT id
FROM PreviousWeatherData
WHERE temperature > previous_temperature
AND recordDate - previous_record_date = 1 -- AND recordDate = PreviousRecordDate + INTERVAL '1 day';
```
